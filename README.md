# AsciiVideoPlayer

This a short and sweet python project I coded, which takes in an input vdeo file, splits it into frames, and then converts each frame to ansi escape codes to create colored ascii text.

Finally it prints it to the terminal.

Caveats:
It can be a little slow on certain terminals, which isn't up to the porgram, so if you use a slow/older terminal, consider upgrading. 
And becuase write speeds in terminals differ, so will playback speed.
